# bootcamp_portfolio

This is my developer portfolio. 

A portfolio is often the first point of contact for employers looking to fill a position or clients in need of a developer to complete a project. A clean and informative portfolio showcases a developer's strongest work and can lead to employment and/or more clients.

It utilizes HTML and CSS and showcases my applications.
