                <p>I am a graphic and web designer. My programming languages of choice are HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla JavaScript. Having worked in fields, ranging from men’s luxury clothing to higher education, I’ve had the privilege of working within talented creative teams to design and develop digital marketing assets including responsive websites, graphic emails and digital ads. I believe that design decisions should be well-informed by a knowledge of code; working in conjunction to provide the best user experience.</p>
                <p>Currently I am a remote graphic designer at 2U Inc., a company that creates software for universities that provide online higher education. On the day-to-day, I design wireframes and prototypes in collaboration with web developers to create web pages for our partners. In my free-time I enjoy building static websites from scratch and going to the movies with my husband.</p>
